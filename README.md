Short paragraph about graceful degradation and service workers:

Graceful Degradation：

Graceful degradation is a strategy in web development. It ensures that even if some features fail or are not supported by the user's browser, the website can still function with basic functions. 

Service Workers：

Service workers are special scripts that act as a memory. They intercept network requests and manage caching. This means that even when offline or when certain resources are unavailable, the website can still provide functionality.
